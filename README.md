# 📱 MyPhone List

**MyPhone List** is a private and secure Android contact management application that stores contacts outside the default phone contact storage to protect user privacy from third-party apps.

---

## 📝 Description

MyPhone List is an **Android native application** designed to solve a common privacy problem faced by smartphone users.

Many applications request access to phone contacts, and once permission is granted, **all stored contacts become accessible**, leading to privacy issues such as unwanted WhatsApp visibility, status sharing, last-seen access, and potential data misuse.

This app stores contacts in a **separate internal database**, completely independent of the device’s default contact storage. As a result:

- Third-party apps cannot access these contacts  
- Users retain full control over which contacts remain private  

The app also supports **easy import, export, and sharing of contacts** between the default contact app and MyPhone List using **VCF and TXT formats**, ensuring flexibility without compromising privacy.

Built using **Kotlin** and **Android Native architecture**, the app focuses on **security, usability, and performance**.
